        "1.**Why Logistic Regression performs reasonably good or bad?**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Answer*: Logistic Regression works better on a linear dataset.If the relationship was linear, LR would have outperformed or matched NN.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.**Why Neural Network performs better or worse?**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Answer*: Neural Network performs better as the given dataset consists of volatility, trend continuation, symmetry and other factors which makes it a non-linear complex datatset which is too noisy and neural network is very well capable of handling this type of datasets as it has multiple hidden layers which helps it to deal with this dataset more easily. It also uses ReLU function making it more compatible for non-linear datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.**The effect of volatility on predictions...**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Answer*:Volatility leads to unpredictability and sudden price fluctuations. This can increase the chances of wrong results. Neural networks can handle this type of data better.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.**The role of trend continuation...**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Answer*:It leads to more accuracy in both the models as it leads to contuinity in trends making it to easier predictions. Neural Network includes other factors for better results.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.**Situations where the model fails and why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Answer*:As discussed above the model can fail in high volatile data, also sudden changes can affect its results strongly.\n",
        "Also, when the network tries to learn too much or too many details in the training data along with the noise from the training data which results in poor performance on unseen or test dataset. When this happens the network fails to generalize the pattern found in the training data."
